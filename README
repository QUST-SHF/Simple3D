This repository holds a Qt project and all source code and resource files for
Simple3D, a 3D model viewer with picking and packing capabilities. The code
requires at least Qt 5.4 with C++11 capabilities enabled and the Boost library.

Simple3D is a 3D model viewer capable of loading multiple STL files, both
binary and ascii, with tens of millions of triangles. In addition to 3D 
rotation and zooming of the whole scene, it offers interactive picking and 
removal of one or more individual models. Endowed with a packing strategy, it 
can efficiently arrange disparate 3D models on a predefined area while 
maintaining a specified minimal gap between the models. The total volume and 
triangle count of the selected and all models is continuously reported at all 
times.

Simple3D is implemented using the Qt's QOpenGL* classes with all 3D 
transformations performed on the GPU. Model picking is implemented by 
off-screen rendering to a frame buffer (QOpenGLFramebufferObject) where each 
model is painted with different color.
